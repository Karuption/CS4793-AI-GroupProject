       "' An Australian woman named Rachael Dixon, 53, passed away after consuming an infusion suspected to contain toxic mushrooms at the Soul Barn Creative Wellbeing Centre in Clunes, north-west of Melbourne. Two other individuals received hospital treatment but have since been discharged. The Victoria Police are investigating the incident and are looking into whether the group intended to consume magic mushrooms.\\n\\nSoul Barn\\'s Facebook page describes it as an \"alternative and holistic health service.\" On the night before the incident, Soul Barn was hosting an event about ancient skincare rituals led by a visiting beautician who used infused herbal oils sourced from local farms and wild-foraged plants. It is unclear if Ms. Dixon and the other two individuals were at this event.\\n\\nSoul Barn has since issued condolences to Ms. Dixon\\'s family and cancelled a planned \"sound healing\" session. The centre remains closed on Tuesday. The Telegraph reached out to Soul Barn for comment.\\n\\nMs. Dixon\\'s son, Matthew, paid tribute to his mother on social media, expressing gratitude for her love and support. Detectives are yet to determine the type of mushrooms that may have been in the drinks.\\n\\nThe popularity of \"guided trips\" involving magic mushrooms has grown in Australia due to research into their potential therapeutic benefits. However, concerns have been raised about a lack of regulation and the possibility of people accidentally ingesting poisonous varieties.\\n\\nEarlier this year, Australian food safety experts issued a warning about the dangers of wild mushrooms. Dr. Evelyn Wong, Victoria\\'s acting chief health officer, stated that there is no home test available to distinguish safe and edible mushrooms from poisonous ones. Cathy Moir, the chairman of the Food Safety Information Council, added that social media influencers have contributed to the popularity of wild foraging.\\n\\nThis incident comes less than a year after the highly publicised case involving Erin Patterson, who has been accused of lacing a family lunch with \"death cap\" fungi, resulting in three fatalities. Patterson has been charged with murder and attempted murder.'"
